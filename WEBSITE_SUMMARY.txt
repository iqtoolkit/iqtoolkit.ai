IQToolkit Analyzer — Product Update Summary (January 2026)
===========================================================

Current State (v0.2.6 — Stable)
- Platforms: PostgreSQL and MongoDB slow query analysis
- PostgreSQL NEW: Database-direct EXPLAIN analysis (no log files needed!)
- AI Providers: 6 providers — Ollama (default), OpenAI, Google Gemini, AWS Bedrock, Anthropic Claude, Azure OpenAI
- Reports: Markdown, JSON, and HTML (MongoDB dashboards)
- IQToolkit Config: Support for database connections with environment variable expansion
- Contextual AI: Performance-aware recommendations (fast/moderate/slow assessment)
- Versioning: Repo artifacts synced to 0.2.6 (Docker labels, VERSION, Python/Node metadata)
- Privacy-first defaults with local Ollama support
- CLI ready; docs refreshed and aligned to current features
- Tooling update: Standardized on Poetry and venv/pip
- Contacts: All repo contact emails standardized to gio@iqtoolkit.ai

Architecture Shift: Modular Monorepo
- We moved from a single-package repo to a modular monorepo to enable faster iteration and clearer boundaries.
- Modules (folders) now include:
  - iqtoolkit_analyzer: Current CLI package (to be service-ized)
  - iqtoolkit-contracts: Shared Pydantic models (Poetry package)
  - iqtoolkit-iqai: AI Copilot service using pydantic-ai (Poetry package)
  - iqtoolkithub: Orchestration gateway that composes Analyzer + IQAI (Poetry package)
  - iqtoolkit-deployment: Helm/K8s deployment assets
- Tooling: Poetry across packages, path dependencies for fast local development
- Root package migrated to Poetry for consistent dependency management
- Why this change: Atomic changes across modules, simpler contracts, and a clean transition to services later without fragmentation into multiple repos.

What’s Next (Roadmap Highlights)
- v0.2.7 (Jan–Feb 2026): Stabilization sprint — EXPLAIN parser hardening, test coverage >80%, docs polish, PyPI publication.
- v0.3.0 (Feb–Mar 2026): Platform modularity & orchestration — Analyzer service, IQAI service, hub gateway, shared contracts, Helm/CI/CD.
- v0.4.0 (May–Jun 2026): Feature completeness — MySQL and SQL Server log analysis, deeper cross-database comparisons.
- v1.0.0 (Jul–Dec 2026): Production-ready CLI with ML-assisted recommendations and full database coverage.

Why It Matters
- Enterprise-readiness: Strong privacy posture with Ollama and clear contracts
- Speed: Path-based development across modules keeps velocity high
- Safety: Centralized contracts reduce integration bugs and drift
