IQToolkit Analyzer — Product Update Summary (November 2025)
===========================================================

Current State (v0.2.2 — Stable)
- Platforms: PostgreSQL and MongoDB slow query analysis
- AI Providers: Ollama (local/remote) and OpenAI — configurable
- Reports: Markdown, JSON, and HTML (MongoDB dashboards)
- Privacy-first defaults with local Ollama support
- CLI ready; docs refreshed and aligned to current features
- Tooling update: Removed legacy 'uv' references; standardized on Poetry and venv/pip
- Contacts: All repo contact emails standardized to gio@iqtoolkit.ai

Architecture Shift: Modular Monorepo
- We moved from a single-package repo to a modular monorepo to enable faster iteration and clearer boundaries.
- Modules (folders) now included:
  - iqtoolkit_analyzer: Current CLI package (to be service-ized)
  - iqtoolkit-contracts: Shared Pydantic models (Poetry package)
  - iqtoolkit-iqai: AI Copilot service using pydantic-ai (Poetry package)
  - iqtoolkithub: Orchestration gateway that composes Analyzer + IQAI (Poetry package)
  - iqtoolkit-deployment: Helm/K8s deployment assets
- Tooling: Poetry across packages, path dependencies for fast local development
- Root package migrated to Poetry for consistent dependency management
- Why this change: Atomic changes across modules, simpler contracts, and a clean transition to services later without fragmentation into multiple repos.

What’s Next (Roadmap Highlights)
- v0.2.3 (Q1 2026): PostgreSQL EXPLAIN Analyzer (RFC-002)
  - Parse EXPLAIN JSON/YAML
  - Extract execution metrics, detect anti-patterns, suggest indexes
  - LLM insights for complex plans
  - MongoDB enhancements: aggregation pipeline optimization, indexing strategy
- v0.3.0 (Q2 2026): Platform modularity & orchestration
  - Service-ize analyzer (optional API)
  - Stand up IQAI service (pydantic-ai)
  - Hub gateway to orchestrate Analyzer + IQAI
  - Helm charts + CI/CD pipelines
- Beyond v0.3.x: Database expansion
  - MySQL and SQL Server analysis & EXPLAIN/plan support

Why It Matters
- Enterprise-readiness: Strong privacy posture with Ollama and clear contracts
- Speed: Path-based development across modules keeps velocity high
- Safety: Centralized contracts reduce integration bugs and drift
