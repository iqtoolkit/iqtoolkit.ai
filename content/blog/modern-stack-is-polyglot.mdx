## The Reality

If you're managing infrastructure today, you aren't just running PostgreSQL. You're running PostgreSQL for relational data, MongoDB for documents, maybe Redis for caching, and other modules/business units that use MySQL or SQL Server instances.

## The Problem

When production breaks at 2 AM, we're forced to context-switch between 4-5 different tools.

- `pg_stat_statements` for Postgres
- `db.currentOp()` or Atlas for Mongo
- Datadog for metrics
- CloudWatch/grep for logs

We spend 90% of our time **correlating** data across these silos and only 10% actually **fixing** the root cause.

## The Solution

I built **iqtoolkit** to be the unified intelligence layer we've been missing. It’s an open-source, self-hosted platform designed to standardize database troubleshooting across engines.

## 🛠 Technical Architecture

### 1. Multi-Database Analyzer (Modular Design)

Instead of separate tools, iqtoolkit uses a modular architecture to analyze different engines under one roof:

- **PostgreSQL Module:** Deep analysis of `EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS)`, index usage stats, and anti-pattern detection (e.g., implicit casting preventing index usage).
- **MongoDB Module:** Aggregation pipeline optimization, document structure analysis, and sharding key recommendations.
- **Future (Q2 2026):** MySQL & SQL Server modules.

### 2. Privacy-First AI Layer (IqAI)

We know you can't paste production query plans into ChatGPT.

- **Default:** Runs 100% local using **Ollama** (Llama 3, Mistral, etc.). Your schema and queries never leave your VPC.
- **Optional:** Configurable OpenAI integration for teams who prefer cloud LLMs.
- **Capability:** It doesn't just "chat." It parses execution plans, identifies bottlenecks (like sequential scans on high-cardinality tables), and generates specific DDL fixes.

### 3. Deployment & Compliance

- **Container-Native:** Ships as Docker containers and Helm charts.
- **Self-Hosted:** Deploy on your own Kubernetes cluster or bare metal.
- **Compliance Ready:** Designed for HIPAA/SOC 2 environments where data sovereignty is non-negotiable.

## 📅 Roadmap

- **v0.2.2 (Now):** Stable release with PostgreSQL & MongoDB slow query analysis, configurable Ollama/OpenAI, and Markdown/JSON/HTML reports.
- **v0.2.3 (Q1 2026):** PostgreSQL EXPLAIN analyzer (RFC-002), anti-pattern detection, index suggestions, and MongoDB enhancements.
- **v0.3.0 (Q2 2026):** Service-ize Analyzer + stand up IQAI service, Hub gateway orchestration, Helm charts & CI/CD.
