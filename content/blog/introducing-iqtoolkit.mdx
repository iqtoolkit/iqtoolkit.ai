I'm a DBA who evolved into an architect. After years optimizing queries in production across PostgreSQL and MongoDB, I realized the real problem isn't individual query tuning—it's **unified intelligence across multiple databases**.

Today, I'm announcing **iqtoolkit.ai** - a self-hosted, open-source database intelligence platform that brings AI-powered analysis to multi-database operations. We're currently in development with **v0.2.0-alpha launching December 2025**.

## What is iqtoolkit.ai?

iqtoolkit.ai is a comprehensive platform designed for DBAs and architects who need intelligent, automated solutions across MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and more. By leveraging your choice of AI (private Ollama or cloud OpenAI), we bring enterprise-grade intelligence to your database workflows **without compromising data privacy**.

**Critical positioning:** This is **self-hosted only**. Deploy via Docker, Kubernetes with Helm charts, or on-premises infrastructure. Your data never leaves your control. No vendor lock-in. Ever.

## What We're Building (v0.2.0-alpha - December 2025)

### 🐘 PostgreSQL Analyzer
Our PostgreSQL analyzer will provide:
- **EXPLAIN plan analysis** with AI-powered recommendations
- **Index suggestions** based on query patterns  
- **Query rewriting** for better performance
- **Anti-pattern detection** to catch common mistakes

### 🍃 MongoDB Analyzer (Parallel Development)
Building MongoDB support simultaneously:
- **Aggregation pipeline optimization**
- **Document structure analysis**
- **Index strategy recommendations**
- **Sharding key optimization**

Both analyzers launching together in v0.2.0-alpha (December 2025).

### 🤖 IqAI - Your Choice of Intelligence

**Ollama (Default - Private, On-Premises)**
- Run locally, data never leaves infrastructure
- Perfect for compliance-first teams (HIPAA, GDPR, SOC 2)
- Deploy via Docker, Kubernetes Helm, or native

**OpenAI (Optional - Cloud, Managed)**
- Maximum performance and capabilities
- For teams prioritizing convenience
- Configurable API key (you control access)

Both will be supported from day one.

### 🛡️ Self-Hosted Deployment

**Docker** (Single Machine)
- Quick testing and development
- Includes optional Ollama container

**Kubernetes with Helm** (Enterprise Scale)
- Production-grade Helm charts
- Multi-environment configs (dev, staging, prod)
- Works on EKS, GKE, AKS, self-managed K8s

**On-Premises** (Complete Control)
- Deploy on your own infrastructure
- Air-gapped installation support
- Perfect for regulated industries

## Why iqtoolkit.ai?

**Multi-Database from Day One**: Unlike tools that specialize in a single database, we're building unified intelligence across MongoDB and PostgreSQL from v0.2.0-alpha.

**Self-Hosted Only**: No SaaS, no cloud hosting, no vendor lock-in. Deploy on YOUR infrastructure. Your data never leaves your control.

**Choice of AI**: Run Ollama locally (private, compliance-ready) OR use OpenAI (cloud, powerful). You decide based on your security requirements.

**Architect-Designed, DBA-Built**: Created by someone who lived the operational pain of managing fragmented database tools across multiple systems.

**Open Source**: MIT or Apache 2.0 license. Full transparency, community-driven development, and freedom to customize.

## Development Timeline

- **November 2025**: RFC published, community feedback collection
- **December 14, 2025**: v0.2.0-alpha release (PostgreSQL + MongoDB analyzers)
- **January 6, 2026**: v0.2.0 stable (production-ready)
- **Q2 2026**: v0.4.0 (MySQL + SQL Server support)

## Getting Involved

We're currently collecting community feedback on our [RFC](https://github.com/iqtoolkit/iqtoolkit.ai/discussions). We want to hear from:
- DBAs managing multi-database environments
- Architects designing database infrastructure
- DevOps teams deploying self-hosted solutions
- Compliance teams evaluating data governance tools

## Built by a DBA, For DBAs and Architects

This isn't a side project. It's the solution I wished existed when I was managing production databases across PostgreSQL and MongoDB simultaneously.

**Self-hosted. Open-source. Multi-database. Privacy-first.**

Let's build the future of database intelligence together. 🚀
