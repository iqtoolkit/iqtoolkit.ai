We're excited to introduce **iqtoolkit.ai** - the only open-source toolkit that seamlessly combines multi-database expertise with AI-powered analytics to transform how you work with databases.

## What is iqtoolkit.ai?

iqtoolkit.ai is a comprehensive platform designed for developers and database administrators who need intelligent, automated solutions for database management across MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and more. By leveraging local AI models through Ollama integration, we bring enterprise-grade intelligence to your database workflows without compromising your data privacy.

## Key Features

### 🤖 Database AI Assistant

Our AI assistant understands natural language queries and converts them into optimized database operations. Whether you're working with MongoDB or PostgreSQL, simply describe what you need and let the AI handle the complexity:

```bash
# Natural language to optimized query
"Find all users who signed up last month and made at least 3 purchases"
```

The AI automatically:

- Generates efficient queries for your specific database
- Suggests optimal indexes
- Recommends schema improvements
- Analyzes query performance

### 📊 Real-Time Metrics & Monitoring

Get instant visibility into your database health with live dashboards that show:

- Query performance trends
- Resource utilization
- Anomaly detection with AI-powered alerts
- Predictive capacity planning

### 🔒 Privacy-First Architecture

Unlike cloud-based solutions, iqtoolkit.ai runs entirely on-premise using Ollama. Your sensitive database metadata never leaves your infrastructure, making it perfect for:

- Healthcare applications (HIPAA compliance)
- Financial services (PCI DSS compliance)
- Any security-conscious organization

### ⚡ Intelligent Query Optimization

Automatically identify and fix slow queries:

- EXPLAIN plan analysis with AI recommendations
