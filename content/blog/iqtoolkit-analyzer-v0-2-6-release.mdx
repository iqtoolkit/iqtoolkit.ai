## 🔧 What's improved in v0.2.6

**Smoother end-to-end workflows** for analyzing slow queries and database health.

**Better error messages and guardrails** so you can trust what the AI suggests before running anything in production.

**Quality-of-life tweaks** based on real-world feedback from early users working with Postgres and MongoDB.

## 🎯 Who this is for

**DBAs and platform engineers** who want faster root-cause analysis.

**Developers** who want "explain this query like I'm busy" instead of digging through raw plans.

**Teams** experimenting with AI-assisted database operations without giving up control.

## 🧪 Try it out

I'm iterating quickly, so feedback is gold. If you want to kick the tires on iqtoolkit-analyzer v0.2.6 and help shape where this goes next, drop a comment or DM and I'll share the repo and quickstart guide.
