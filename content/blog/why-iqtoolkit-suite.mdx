In all my years as a database professional, I've been challenged countless times to troubleshoot multiple locks, logs, metrics, server status—you name it—all to solve a single problem. This is incredibly time-consuming, especially when the system is down, production is halted, and the company is losing money by the minute.

**I wanted to provide database professionals with a tool to correlate this data faster.**

## Human Intuition + AI Speed = Better Outcomes

Let me be clear: **human intuition is always superior to AI**. But AI is faster than humans when it comes to correlating data. That's where the iqtoolkit suite comes in.

This tool is meant to be an **aid** for database professionals—helping us troubleshoot faster and identify how to fix problems. I'm hoping that as these tools grow, they'll be able to predict future problems and detect anomalies before they become critical incidents.

But in no way should we see this tool as a **replacement** for a DBA.

## AI Must Be Kept in Check

You should never trust AI to make the final call for any decision. AI is still unpredictable. But what it _can_ do is free database professionals from the manual, repetitive work—giving us time to do the things we actually want to do.

**How many times have you told your manager:**

> "I wish I could build that automation... implement that architecture improvement... but I don't have time because I have to keep this boat afloat."

That's exactly what I'm trying to solve with the iqtoolkit suite. I want to **free ourselves from manual correlation work** so we can focus on:

- **Architecture** - Designing better systems
- **Automation** - Building self-healing infrastructure
- **Engineering** - Creating tools that scale
- **Administration** - But with AI assistance, all in one place

## AI is Not a Replacement—It's an Assistant

The industry is evolving. Every role in IT is going through an engineering transformation. Everybody has to know a little bit of coding now. Python, Bash, and PowerShell have become indispensable tools.

There was a time when people would say, _"I don't do coding—that's not my job."_

**That's not the case anymore.**

With automation, Infrastructure as Code (IaC), everything we do is coded:

- Terraform for provisioning
- Ansible for configuration
- Kubernetes for orchestration
- YAML for everything

Automation is critical nowadays, but it **requires time**. And to have that time, we can't afford to manually:

1. Jump into Datadog to check metrics
2. Switch to logs to correlate errors
3. Look at dashboards side-by-side
4. Manually connect the dots

Sure, we can build dashboards with metrics and logs side-by-side. But we still have to **manually correlate** the data. That's where AI helps us. It automates this correlation.

**Is it always 100% accurate? No.**
**Is it accurate enough to reduce Mean Time To Recovery (MTTR)? Absolutely.**

## Don't See AI as Your Enemy—It's Your Ally

In summary, I hope this tool makes our lives easier as database professionals.

**Don't see AI as your enemy. See it as your ally.**

AI is a train that's not going to stop. Don't step in front of it. **Get on the train, and you'll be okay.**

The iqtoolkit suite is my attempt to help all of us—database professionals, SREs, platform engineers—ride that train together while keeping control of our craft.
