## Why Should You Care?

**iqtoolkit is a unified, AI-powered database intelligence platform** that correlates metrics, logs, and query performance across PostgreSQL and MongoDB—automatically. It's built to reduce Mean Time To Recovery (MTTR) during production incidents by doing the manual correlation work for you, so you can focus on solving problems instead of hunting for them.

**The bottom line:** Stop spending 45 minutes correlating data during 2 AM outages. Let AI do that in seconds while you focus on the fix.

## The 2 AM Production Outage Scenario

Picture this: It's 2 AM. You're groggy, trying to wake up. Your phone is buzzing—production is down.

You jump on your laptop and start the familiar dance:

1. Open Datadog to check metrics
2. Switch to logs to find errors
3. Pull up query stats in another tab
4. Scroll up and down, trying to see correlations
5. Hope everything is in the same dashboard (it never is)

Meanwhile, the system is down. Your VP, director, or manager isn't "pressuring you," but they need to know the problem ASAP. The clock is ticking. The company is losing money.

**What if there was a better way?**

Instead of jumping between tools for 45 minutes, you open iqtoolkit. Within seconds, you see:

- **An automated correlation report** connecting CPU spikes to slow queries to missing indexes
- **AI-powered recommendations** suggesting the exact fix
- **An intelligent agent** you can ask follow-up questions: "What changed in the last hour?" or "Show me similar incidents from last month"

The AI grabs the data, correlates it, and presents it—all while you're still waking up.

You see the problem clearly. You apply the fix. **You solve it before your VP even calls.**

_(Not guaranteed, but definitely possible. And way better than the alternative.)_

## Why I Built iqtoolkit

In all my years as a database professional, I've been challenged countless times to troubleshoot multiple locks, logs, metrics, server status—you name it—all to solve a single problem. This is incredibly time-consuming, especially when the system is down, production is halted, and the company is losing money by the minute.

**I wanted to provide database professionals with a tool to correlate this data faster.**

## What is iqtoolkit?

**iqtoolkit is a comprehensive, self-hosted database intelligence platform** that provides AI-powered query analysis and performance insights across multiple database types. Currently in development with **v0.2.0-alpha launching December 2025**.

**Core capabilities:**

- **Multi-Database Analyzer** - Unified tool with modules for PostgreSQL and MongoDB (MySQL and SQL Server planned for Q2 2026)
  - PostgreSQL: EXPLAIN plan analysis, index recommendations, query optimization
  - MongoDB: Aggregation pipeline optimization, document structure analysis, sharding strategies
- **IqAI Intelligence Layer** - Configurable AI (private Ollama or cloud OpenAI) for automated troubleshooting and correlation
- **Self-Hosted Architecture** - Deploy on YOUR infrastructure (Docker, Kubernetes) with no cloud dependencies or vendor lock-in

Built to solve real production challenges across SQL and NoSQL databases—without privacy compromises. **Unified Dashboard (IqToolkitHub)** and advanced governance features are planned for future releases.

## Human Intuition + AI Speed = Better Outcomes

Let me be clear: **human intuition is always superior to AI**. But AI is faster than humans when it comes to correlating data across metrics, logs, and database performance. That's where iqtoolkit comes in.

This tool is meant to be an **aid** for database professionals—helping us troubleshoot faster and identify how to fix problems. I'm hoping that as these tools grow, they'll be able to predict future problems and detect anomalies before they become critical incidents.

But in no way should we see this tool as a **replacement** for a DBA.

## AI Must Be Kept in Check

You should never trust AI to make the final call for any decision. AI is still unpredictable. But what it _can_ do is free database professionals from the manual, repetitive work—giving us time to do the things we actually want to do.

**How many times have you told your manager:**

> "I wish I could build that automation... implement that architecture improvement... but I don't have time because I have to keep this boat afloat."

That's exactly what I'm trying to solve with iqtoolkit. I want to **free ourselves from manual correlation work** so we can focus on:

- **Architecture** - Designing better systems
- **Automation** - Building self-healing infrastructure
- **Engineering** - Creating tools that scale
- **Administration** - But with AI assistance, all in one place

## AI is Not a Replacement—It's an Assistant

The industry is evolving. Every role in IT is going through an engineering transformation. Everybody has to know a little bit of coding now. Python, Bash, and PowerShell have become indispensable tools.

There was a time when people would say, _"I don't do coding—that's not my job."_

**That's not the case anymore.**

With automation, Infrastructure as Code (IaC), everything we do is coded:

- Terraform for provisioning
- Ansible for configuration
- Kubernetes for orchestration
- YAML for everything

Automation is critical nowadays, but it **requires time**. And to have that time, we can't afford to manually:

1. Jump into Datadog to check metrics
2. Switch to logs to correlate errors
3. Look at dashboards side-by-side
4. Manually connect the dots

Sure, we can build dashboards with metrics and logs side-by-side. But we still have to **manually correlate** the data. That's where AI helps us. It automates this correlation.

**Is it always 100% accurate? No.**
**Is it accurate enough to reduce Mean Time To Recovery (MTTR)? Absolutely.**

## Don't See AI as Your Enemy—It's Your Ally

In summary, I hope this tool makes our lives easier as database professionals.

**Don't see AI as your enemy. See it as your ally.**

AI is a train that's not going to stop. Don't step in front of it. **Get on the train, and you'll be okay.**

iqtoolkit is my attempt to help all of us—database professionals, SREs, platform engineers—ride that train together while keeping control of our craft.

**Ready to take back your time?** Try v0.2.0-alpha with full launch in December 14, 2025 with PostgreSQL and MongoDB modules, Docker deployment, Kubernetes Helm charts, and your choice of AI provider (Ollama or OpenAI).
